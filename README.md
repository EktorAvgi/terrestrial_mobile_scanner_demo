# terrestrial_mobile_scanner_demo
This project shows a 3D BIM model with (FPS) where user is holding a terrestrial mobile scanner (Horizon scanner)

The demo shows a user is holding a Horizon scanner where he can walk in 3D BIM environment. 

The 3D BIM model is been generated from a 3D point cloud collected from a Horizon unit. Then imported into Unity and created the 3D model. 

In the model there is C# cpde for the rotation of the scanner while walking, there is a shaders implemented for the textures, physics collider, physics for the tree movement, and lighting modification to make the model photorealistic. 

See below version 1.0. Version 1.1 will include doors opening and warning messages for best practice in order to export optimal results (3D PC).
