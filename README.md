# terrestrial_mobile_scanner_demo
This project shows a 3D BIM model with (FPS) where user is holding a terrestrial mobile scanner (Horizon scanner)

The demo shows a user is holding a Horizon scanner where he can walk in 3D BIM environment. 

The 3D BIM model is been generated from a 3D point cloud collected from a Horizon unit. Then imported into Unity and created the 3D model. 

In the model there is C# cpde for the rotation of the scanner while walking, there is a shaders implemented for the textures, physics collider, physics for the tree movement, and lighting modification to make the model photorealistic.
